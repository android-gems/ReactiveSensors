Android library monitoring hardware sensors with RxJava Observables.

Library is compatible with RxJava 1.0.+ and RxAndroid 1.0.+ and uses them under the hood.

min sdk version = 9

Usage
-----

Code sample below demonstrates how to observe Gyroscope sensor. 

Please note that we are filtering events occuring when sensors reading change with `ReactiveSensorEvent.filterSensorChanged()` method. There's also event describing change of sensor's accuracy, which can be filtered with `ReactiveSensorEvent.filterAccuracyChanged()` method. When we don't apply any filter, we will be notified both about sensor readings and accuracy changes.

```java
new ReactiveSensors(context).observeSensor(Sensor.TYPE_GYROSCOPE)
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    .filter(ReactiveSensorEvent.filterSensorChanged())
    .subscribe(new Action1<ReactiveSensorEvent>() {
      @Override public void call(ReactiveSensorEvent reactiveSensorEvent) {
        SensorEvent event = reactiveSensorEvent.getSensorEvent();

        float x = event.values[0];
        float y = event.values[1];
        float z = event.values[2];

        String message = String.format("x = %f, y = %f, z = %f", x, y, z);

        Log.d("gyroscope readings", message);
      }
    });
}
```

We can observe any hardware sensor in the same way. You can check [list of all sensors in official Android documentation](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview.html#sensors-intro). To get list of all sensors available on the current device, you can use `getSensors()` method available in `ReactiveSensors` class.

Example
-------

Exemplary application, which reads gyroscope sensor is located in `app` directory of this repository. You can easily change `SENSOR_TYPE` variable to read values from a different sensor.

Good practices
--------------

### Checking whether sensor exists

We should check whether device has concrete sensor before we start observing it. 

We can do it in the following way:

```java
if (reactiveSensors.hasSensor(SENSOR_TYPE)) {
  // observe sensor
} else {
  // show error message
}
```

### Subscribing and ubsubscribing observables

When we are using subscriptions in Activity, we should subscribe them in `onResume()` method and unsubscribe them in `onPause()` method.

### Filtering stream

When we want to receive **only sensor updates**, we should use `ReactiveSensorEvent.filterSensorChanged()` method in `filter(...)` method from RxJava.

When we want to receive **only accurracy updates**, we should use `ReactiveSensorEvent.filterAccuracyChanged()` method in `filter(...)` method from RxJava.

If we don't apply any filter, we will receive both accuracy and sensor readings updates.

### Other practices

See also [Best Practices for Accessing and Using Sensors](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview.html#sensors-practices).

Download
--------

You can depend on the library through Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.pwittchen</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactivesensors</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

or through Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
  compile 'com.github.pwittchen:reactivesensors:0.0.1'
}
```

Tests
-----

Tests are available in `library/src/androidTest/java/` directory and can be executed on emulator or Android device from Android Studio or CLI with the following command:

```
./gradlew connectedCheck
```

Code style
----------

Code style used in the project is called `SquareAndroid` from Java Code Styles repository by Square available at: https://github.com/square/java-code-styles. Currently, library doesn't have checkstyle verification attached. It can be done in the future.
